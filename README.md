# Facial_Emotion_Recognition
This project detects facial emotion in real time. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral) 
The libraries used are pandas,numpy,tensorflow,keras and opencv
Facial_Emotion_Recognition is a rudimentary project but has multifaceted prospects. It could be used to recommend movies, songs (by reading the emotions), to get feedback from the users and to make chatbots more interative.
